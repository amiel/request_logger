This simple Rack app just logs to stdout each request it receives.

You can also use this as middleware, like this:

  require 'request_logger'
  use RequestLogger
  run Sinatra::Application


- or -

  require 'request_logger'
  use RequestLogger, 'log/requests.log'
  run Sinatra::Application


This is great for troubleshooting requests.
